It's time to explore, understand, and \u0000y.\" — HackRx Core Team 🌍 The Strange New World Sachin, one of the core members of HackRx, woke up in a strange version of Earth. Everything looked familiar — the air, the people, the languages — but something was… off. He walked through the streets of a place that seemed like Delhi. But there it was — the Gateway of India standing tall where India Gate should be. Confused, Sachin kept exploring. He realized he had landed in a parallel world, where famous landmarks existed, but they were in the wrong cities. Each city had been swapped with the identity of another, and now it was up to Sachin — and you — to make sense of this twisted map. Your goal: Find the \u0000ight number which takes him the real world 🧩 A Tangled Trail — What Sachin Noticed \u0000 Indian Cities Landmark Current Location 🏛 Gateway of India Delhi 🏛 India Gate Mumbai 🕌 Charminar Chennai 🏖",
