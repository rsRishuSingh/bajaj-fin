But there it was \u2014 the Gateway of India\nstanding tall where India Gate should be. Confused, Sachin kept exploring.\n\nHe realized he had landed in a parallel world, where famous landmarks existed, but they were in the wrong\ncities.\n\nEach city had been swapped with the identity of another, and now it was up to Sachin \u2014 and you \u2014 to make\nsense of this twisted map.\n\nYour goal: Find the flight number which takes him the real world\n\n\ud83e\udde9 A Tangled Trail \u2014 What Sachin Noticed\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 Indian Cities",
